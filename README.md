    Random forest: Random forest is a type of ensemble model that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. It is often used for classification tasks, such as predicting whether a customer will churn or not, or whether a patient has a particular disease or not. Random forest can handle high-dimensional data and can handle missing values, making it a good choice for many real-world data sets.

    Logistic regression: Logistic regression is a type of regression model that is used for classification tasks. It is often used when the label is binary (e.g., 0 or 1, True or False), but it can also be used for multi-class classification tasks. Logistic regression is a good choice when you have a small number of features and you want to understand the relationship between each feature and the label.

    Linear regression: Linear regression is a type of regression model that is used to predict a continuous label (e.g., a price, a score, a measurement). It is a good choice when the relationship between the features and the label is approximately linear, and when you have a large number of examples. Linear regression is often used to make predictions about trends or to understand the relationship between different variables.
